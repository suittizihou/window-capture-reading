For all files under `tests/`:

- Only use `pytest` and related plugins (do not use `unittest`).
- Mirror the structure of `src/` under `tests/`.
- Ensure every test file contains an `__init__.py`.
- All tests must be fully type-annotated.
- All tests must include descriptive docstrings.

If TYPE_CHECKING is required, import:

```python
from _pytest.capture import CaptureFixture
from _pytest.fixtures import FixtureRequest
from _pytest.logging import LogCaptureFixture
from _pytest.monkeypatch import MonkeyPatch
from pytest_mock.plugin import MockerFixture
