Organize the project into the following clear structure:

- `src/` contains the application code.
  - Structure it into `services/` (business logic) and `utils/` (utilities).
- `tests/` mirrors the structure of `src/` and contains unit tests.
- `docs/` stores documentation materials.
- `config/` stores configuration and environment files.
- `resources/` stores static files (e.g., images).

Include `__init__.py` files where needed.

Configuration should be managed using environment variables.
